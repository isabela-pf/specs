## Description

<!--
Briefly and clearly describe the proposal.
Explain the general need and the advantages of this specific proposal.
If relevant, include examples of how the new functionality would be used,
intended use-cases, and pseudo-code illustrating its use.
-->

### Intro

Scientific Python communities need to be accessible. This SPEC is an agreement between communities to actively make their work more accessible, investigate accessibility solutions where they find gaps in existing recommendations, and share this knowledge and efforts across projects whenever possible. Stuff like that goes here.

### Accessibility standards 

I think this section needs a clearer name.

#### Global standards

Accessibility standards already exist, and we respect those first! As far as I know, this section is mainly about WCAG and/or anything else we may want to highlight as comprehensive, non-ecosystem-specific resources.

#### Scientific Python recommendations

This section has a bulleted list of specific recommendations in response to the ecosystem's needs.

##### Existing recommendations

- Image descriptions (link to this resource)

##### Future (requested?) recommendations

- Pending

## Community

Who, what, where, when, why, and how to get involved. I do still have some questions here. But I know we want something about this.

## Implementation

<!--
Discuss how this would be implemented.
-->

A full description of the implementation is being written [here](https://github.com/scientific-python/accessibility.scientific-python.org).
You can also view a [rendered version of that documentation](https://accessibility.scientific-python.org).

### Core Project Endorsement

<!--
Discuss what it means for a core project to endorse this SPEC.
-->

### Ecosystem Adoption

<!--
Discuss what it means for a project to adopt this SPEC.
-->

## Notes

<!--
Include a bulleted list of annotated links, comments,
and other ancillary information as needed.
